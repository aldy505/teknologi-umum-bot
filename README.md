# Bot for Teknologi Umum

> Klik disini untuk [README namun dalam Bahasa Indonesia](./README_id.md)

Basically a _bleeding edge_ telegram bot to fulfill Teknologi Umum's _bleeding edge_ needs. Teknologi Umum is an Indonesian telegram group made for people to talk about.. basically anything. You can join through [this link](https://t.me/teknologi_umum). First thing you need to do is mute the group, it's so noisy.

What can this bot do? Well, _bleeding edge_ stuffs! You'll find everything when you interact with [the bot on Telegram](https://t.me/TeknologiUmumBot) or read straight away to the [usage documentation](./docs/USAGE.md).

Feel free to contribute and add some _bleeding edge_ features.

# Can I invite the bot to my group?

Absolutely! Here's how:

1. Start [the bot](https://t.me/TeknologiUmumBot) on Telegram via private message, there is a "Start Bot" button.
2. Go to your group, on Telegram Desktop there is a 3 dotted menu on the top right, click it and go to "Add Members". Supposely in Telegram Mobile, it should be the same.
3. Search for `@TeknologiUmumBot`
4. Once he's inside, please made him an admin. If you didn't do this, the bot is pretty much useless. It can't read or send any message.
5. Spread the good news!
